# Alarm System for Cybersecurity

## Project Overview:

The project aims to develop a **C++-based alarm system** that detects malware attempting to steal user information. The system integrates **Agentic AI**, utilizing a generative algorithm to identify suspicious activity on a user's computer. This AI-driven approach enables real-time malware detection, allowing cybersecurity analysts to proactively counter threats before they compromise sensitive data.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** Uses Agentic AI with generative algorithms to recognize abnormal system behavior.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Instantly notifies users of potential malware attempting to steal information.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refines threat detection through pattern analysis.
- **C++ Efficiency:** Built for high-performance security analysis with minimal system overhead.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Compatible with cybersecurity monitoring frameworks.

## Usage
1. **Installation**  
   - Clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alarm-system.git
     ```
   - Compile the C++ project using your preferred compiler.

2. **Configuration**  
   - Adjust detection sensitivity in the configuration file (`config.json`).
   - Define custom rules for malware identification.

3. **Execution**  
   - Run the system:  
     ```bash
     ./alarm-system
     ```
   - Monitor logs for detected threats and alerts.

4. **Monitoring**  
   - Use LangGraph and Gemini for threat visualization and decision-making insights.
