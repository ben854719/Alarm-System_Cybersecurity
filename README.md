Project Title : Alarm System for Cybersecurity

Summary:

The project aims to develop a C++-based alarm system that detects malware attempting to steal user information. The system will integrate Agentic AI, which employs a generative algorithm to identify suspicious activity on a user's computer. This AI-driven approach will enable real-time malware detection, allowing cybersecurity analysts to proactively counter threats before they compromise sensitive data.

Furthermore, the Agentic AI will assist cybersecurity professionals in protecting a company's mainframe by recognizing and mitigating anomalies that indicate potential security breaches. This integration will enhance threat prevention strategies, making security operations more efficient and effective

Computer Skills: C++, LangGraph, and Gemini.
